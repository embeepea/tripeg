Triangle Peg Puzzle
-------------------

This is a little program that I wrote just for fun to solve the triangle peg puzzle.

![puzzle image](./puzzle.jpg?raw=true)

The goal is to remove pegs, one at a time, by jumping one peg over another, and to
end up with just one peg remaining.

This program uses a brute-force depth first search to find a sequence of moves
that solves the puzzle.

It's written in JavaScript and uses the HTML5 canvas element to animate the solution.

You can see a running version of the program [http://www.geomtech.com/tripeg](here).
